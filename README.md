# Solutions for game TIS-100

TIS-100 is a wonderful game for programer beginner. The code used in the game has same basic concepts of Assemble programing language. 

So it's great for someone who is not programmer but want to have a taste of programmer's daily work. 

It's also a great practice for programmer who never used Assemble programming language before. 

I try to make the best solution for each segment in this project.

Enjoy and have fun.
